# OPP Finale Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** by implementing a **Course Registration System**.
The system is designed to manage course definitions, student enrollment, notifications, and more, using OOP concepts and various design patterns.

---

## Key Features
- **Course Management**: Add, remove, and manage courses.
- **Student Enrollment**: Enroll students in courses with different strategies.
- **Notifications System**: Notify students about course updates (e.g., availability, schedule changes).
- **CLI Interface**: User-friendly Command-Line Interface for interaction.
- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Strategy Pattern**: For flexible enrollment strategies.
  - **Composite Pattern**: To manage course hierarchies.
  - **Observer Pattern**: For notifications.
  - **Factory Pattern**: For dynamic course creation.
  - **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of the registration system.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing.
- **Maven** (optional): Dependency and build management.

## Structure
The project is divided into multiple components:
1. **Models**:
   - `Course` (Abstract and Types: Seminar, Elective, Mandatory)
   - `Participant` (Types: Student, Lecturer, Practitioner)
2. **Patterns**:
   - Strategy: `EnrollmentStrategy` with `StandardEnrollment` and `FastTrackEnrollment`.
   - Composite: `AirlineComponent`, `Airline`, `Flight`.
   - Observer: `CourseAvailabilityNotifier`, `CourseObserver`.
   - Command: Actions like adding a course to cart or requesting notifications.
   - Factory: `CourseFactory` for dynamic course creation.
3. **Controller**:
   - `RegistrationSystem`: Centralized singleton for managing courses.
4. **CLI**:
   - `CourseRegistrationCLI`: Command-line interaction.
